The data structure stored in county_data will be a dictionary with state abbreviations as its keys. Each state abbreviation will map to another dictionary, whose keys are strings of the county names in that state. Each county name will in turn map to a dictionary with just two keys, 'tracts' and 'pop'. These keys map to the number of census tracts and the population for the county. For example, the dictionary will look similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "{'AK': {'Aleutians East': {'pop': 3141, 'tracts': 1},\n",
    "        'Aleutians West': {'pop': 5561, 'tracts': 2},\n",
    "        'Anchorage': {'pop': 291826, 'tracts': 55},\n",
    "        'Bethel': {'pop': 17013, 'tracts': 3},\n",
    "        'Bristol Bay': {'pop': 997, 'tracts': 1},\n",
    "        --snip--\n",
    "If the previous dictionary were stored in county_data, the following expressions would evaluate like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> county_data['AK']['Anchorage']['pop']\n",
    "291826\n",
    ">>> county_data['AK']['Anchorage']['tracts']\n",

    "county_data[state abbrev][county]['pop']\n",
    "Now that you know how county_data will be structured, you can write the code that will fill it with the county data. Add the following code to the bottom of your program:\n",

    "\n",
    "The other code is there because you cannot add a county dictionary as the value for a state abbreviation key until the key itself exists in county_data. (That is, county_data['AK']['Anchorage']['tracts'] += 1 will cause an error if the 'AK' key doesn’t exist yet.) To make sure the state abbreviation key exists in your data structure, you need to call the setdefault() method to set a value if one does not already exist for state ❶.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as the county_data dictionary needs a dictionary as the value for each state abbreviation key, each of those dictionaries will need its own dictionary as the value for each county key ❷.

(If you ever lose track of the dictionary structure, look back at the example dictionary at the start of this section.)\n",

    "After the for loop has finished, the county_data dictionary will contain all of the population and tract information keyed by county and state. At this point, you could program more code to write this data to a text file or another Excel spreadsheet. For now, let’s just use the pprint.pformat() function to write the county_data dictionary value as a massive string to a file named census2010.py. Add the following code to the bottom of your program (making sure to keep it un-indented so that it stays outside the for loop):\n",

This may seem complicated, but the advantage is that you can now import census2010.py just like any other Python module. In the interactive shell, change the current working directory to the folder with your newly created census2010.py file and then import it:\n",
