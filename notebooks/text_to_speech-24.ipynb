Next, define the speak() function to accept a string argument (just like print() did), but have it both print the string to the screen and say it out loud. For example, you’ll replace this line of code\n",

    "To make full use of the speech-generation feature, let’s change the 'Your guess is too low.' and 'Your guess is too high.' text to say the player’s guess. For example, the computer should say, “Your guess, 42, is too low.” You can also add a voice feature to other projects in this book, such as the rock, paper, scissors game."
