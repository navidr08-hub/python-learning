    "### Project 11: Fake Blockchain Cryptocurrency Scam\n",
    "In this project, we’ll use Google Sheets as a fake blockchain to track the transactions of Boringcoin, a cryptocurrency scam I’m promoting. (It turns out that investors and customers don’t care if your blockchain product uses a real blockchain data structure; they will give you money anyway.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The URL https://autbor.com/boringcoin redirects to the Google Sheets URL for Boringcoin’s blockchain. The spreadsheet has three columns: the sender of the transaction, the recipient of the transaction, and the amount of the transaction. The amount is deducted from the sender and added to the recipient. If the sender is 'PRE-MINE', this money is created out of thin air and added to the recipient account. Figure 15-5 shows this Google Sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first transaction has the sender 'PRE-MINE' and the recipient 'Al Sweigart', and the amount is a humble 1000000000. The 'Al Sweigart' account then transfers 19116 Boringcoins to 'Miles Bron', who then transfers 118 Boringcoins to 'not_a_scammer'. The fourth transaction transfers 16273 Boringcoins from 'Al Sweigart' to 'some hacker'. (I did not authorize this transaction and have since stopped using python12345 as my Google account password.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s write two programs. First, the auditBoringcoin.py program examines all the transactions and generates a dictionary of all accounts and their current balance. Second, the addBoringcoinTransaction.py program adds a row to the end of the Google Sheets for a new transaction. These blockchain programs are just for fun and not real (though “real” blockchain projects such as NFTs and “web3” are just as much a fantasy)."

    "#### Step 1: Audit the Fake Blockchain\n",
    "We need to write a program to examine the entire “blockchain” and determine the current balance of all accounts. We’ll use a dictionary to hold this data, where the keys are strings of the account name and the values are integers of how many Boringcoins are in them. We also want the program to display how many total Boringcoins are in the cryptocurrency network. We can start by importing EZSheets and setting up the dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import ezsheets\n",
    "ss = ezsheets.Spreadsheet('https://autbor.com/boringcoin')\n",
    "accounts = {}  # Keys are names, and values are amounts.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we’ll loop through every row in the spreadsheet, identifying the sender, recipient, and amount. Keep in mind that Google Sheets always returns data as a string, so we need to convert it to an integer to do math with the amount value:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Each row is a transaction. Loop over each one:\n",
    "for row in ss.sheets[0].getRows():\n",
    "    sender, recipient, amount = row[0], row[1], int(row[2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the sender is the special account 'PRE-MINE', then it is simply a source of infinite money into other accounts. All of the best cryptocurrency scams use pre-mined coins, and ours is no exception. Add the amount to the recipient account in the accounts dictionary. The setdefault() method sets the value of the account to 0 if it doesn’t already exist in the dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    if sender == 'PRE-MINE':\n",
    "        # The 'PRE-MINE' sender invents money out of thin air.\n",
    "        accounts.setdefault(recipient, 0)\n",
    "        accounts[recipient] += amount\n",
    "```\n",
    "Otherwise, we should deduct the amount from the sender and add it to the recipient:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Move funds from the sender to the recipient.\n",
    "        accounts.setdefault(sender, 0)\n",
    "        accounts.setdefault(recipient, 0)\n",
    "        accounts[sender] -= amount\n",
    "        accounts[recipient] += amount\n",
    "```\n",
    "After the loop finishes, we can see the current balances by printing the accounts dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "`print(accounts)`\n",
    "As part of our audit, let’s also go through this dictionary and add up the totals of everyone’s balance to find out how many Boringcoins are in the entire network. Start a total variable at 0, and then have a for loop go through each value in the key-value pairs of the accounts dictionary. After adding each value to total, we can print the total amount of Boringcoins:\n",

    "for amount in accounts.values():\n",
    "    total += amount\n",

    "import sys, ezsheets\n",

Note that you don’t have permission to edit the Boringcoin Google Sheets, so open that URL in a web browser while logged in to your Google account and then select FileMake a Copy to copy it to your Google Account. Then, replace the 'https://autbor.com/boringcoin' string with a string of your Google Sheet’s URL from the browser address bar:\n",

    "ss = ezsheets.Spreadsheet('https://autbor.com/boringcoin')\n",
    "sheet = ss.sheets[0]\n",

    "Finally, you should get the number of rows in the sheet, increase it by one, and then fill in the columns of this row with the sender, recipient, and amount data:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Add one more row to the sheet for a new transaction:\n",
    "sheet.rowCount += 1\n",
    "\n",

    "sheet[2, sheet.rowCount] = recipient\n",

You can rerun the auditBoringcoin.py program to see the updated account balances of everyone in the cryptocurrency network.\n",

The columns of the first sheet in this spreadsheet are BEANS PER JAR, JARS, and TOTAL BEANS. The TOTAL BEANS column is the product of the numbers in the BEANS PER JAR and JARS columns. However, there is a mistake in one of the 15,000 rows in this sheet. That’s too many rows to check by hand. Luckily, you can write a script that checks the totals.\n",
