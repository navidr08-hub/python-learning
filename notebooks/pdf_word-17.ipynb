Instead, you can write a program that will decrypt the PDF by trying every possible English word until it finds one that works. This is called a brute-force password attack.

You should try both the uppercase and lowercase forms of each word. (On my laptop, going through all 88,000 uppercase and lowercase words from the dictionary file takes a couple of minutes. This is why you shouldn’t use a simple English word for your passwords.)"
