    "- The `__file__` variable contains the .py file’s path as a string. For example, if I run a yourScript.py file in my home folder, it evaluates to `'C:\\Users\\al\\yourScript.py'`\n",
    "- The `sys.executable` variable contains the full path and file of the Python interpreter program itself, and the `sys.version` variable contains the string that appears at the top of the interactive shell with version information about the Python interpreter.\n",
    "- The `sys.version_info.major` and `sys.version_info.minor` variables contain integers of the major and minor version numbers of the Python interpreter. On my laptop running Python version 3.13.1, these are 3 and 13, respectively. You can also pass `sys.version_info` to the `list()` function to obtain more specific information: `list(sys.version_info)` returns `[3, 13, 1 'final', 0]` on my laptop. Having the version information in this form is much easier to work with than trying to pull it out of the sys.version string.\n",
    "- The os.name variable contains the string 'nt' if running on Windows and 'posix' if running on macOS or Linux. This is useful if your Python script needs to run different code depending on what operating system it’s running on. For more specific operating system identification, the sys.platform variable contains 'win32' on Windows, 'darwin' on macOS, and 'linux' on Linux.\n",

    "### Colorful Text with Bext\n",
    "You can print colorful text using the third-party Bext package built on top of Jonathan Hartley’s Colorama package. Install Bext with pip by following the instructions in Appendix A. Bext only works in programs run from a terminal window, and not from Mu or most other code editors. To have print() produce colorful text, call the fg() and bg() functions to change the (foreground) text color or the background color with a string argument such as 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'purple', 'cyan', or 'white'. You can also pass 'reset' to change the color back to the terminal window’s default color. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell:"

Next, the program calls bext.goto() to position the cursor and bext.fg() to change the text color before printing various fish out of text characters like ><)))*>.
