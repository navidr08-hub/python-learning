    "### Email-Based Computer Control\n",
    "Write a program that checks an email or ntfy account every 15 minutes for any instructions you send it and executes those instructions automatically. For example, BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer downloading system. Using free BitTorrent software such as qBittorrent, you can download large media files on your home computer. If you send the program a (completely legal, not at all piratical) BitTorrent link, the program will eventually check its email or look for ntfy notifications, find this message, extract the link, and then launch qBittorrent to start downloading the file. This way, you can have your home computer begin downloads while you’re away, and finish the (completely legal, not at all piratical) download by the time you return home.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 19 covered how to launch programs on your computer using the subprocess.Popen() function. For example, the following call would launch the qBittorrent program, along with a torrent file:\n",

    "```\n",
    "qbProcess = subprocess.Popen(['C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\qBittorrent\\\\\n",
    "qbittorrent.exe', 'shakespeare_complete_works.torrent'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you’ll want the program to make sure the emails come from you. In particular, you might want to require that the emails contain a password, since it is fairly trivial for hackers to fake a “from” address in emails. The program should delete the emails it finds so that it doesn’t repeat instructions every time it checks the email account. As an extra feature, have the program email or text you a confirmation every time it executes a command. Since you won’t be sitting in front of the computer that is running the program, it’s a good idea to use the logging functions (see Chapter 5) to write a text file log that you can check if errors come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qBittorrent program (as well as other BitTorrent applications) has a feature that enables it to quit automatically after the download completes. Chapter 19 explained how you can determine when a launched application has quit with the wait() method for Popen objects. The wait() method call will block until qBittorrent has stopped, and then your program can email or text you a notification that the download has completed.\n",
    "\n",
