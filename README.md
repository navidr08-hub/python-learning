# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains jupyter notebooks documenting my journey of learning Python. I will be going through the online book called "Automate Boring Stuff with Python"

I’m using this repo to track progress, organize knowledge, and share what I learn.

There will be 1 jupyter notebook for each chapter of the book "Automate Boring Stuff with Python", each notebook will have:
 - Notes
  - Only contains notes I thought was worth taking
 - Practice Questions and Answers
 - Exercises (Code Snippets)
  - Some are answered with code snippets while most have their respective script in the programs/practice folder

To run any of the programs it is necessary to have at least **python 3.10.12** and to create a virtualenv with the python dependencies required for each program. Then run the program from the virtualenv.

The notebooks are found in the notebooks/ directory each named according to the chapter.
