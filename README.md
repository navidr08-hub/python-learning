# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains jupyter notebooks documenting my journey of learning Python. I will be going through the online book called "Automate Boring Stuff with Python"

Iâ€™m using this repo to track progress, organize knowledge, and share what I learn.

There will be 1 jupyter notebook for each chapter of the book "Automate Boring Stuff with Python", each notebook will have:
 - Notes
  - Each section of notes will only have the things that I forgot or needed to brush up on
 - Practice Questions and Answers
 - Exercises (Code Snippets)

The notebooks are found in the notebooks/ directory each named according to the chapter.
